# Desert Thunder's Dotfiles

This book is a collection of notes and guides around my personal dotfiles. It's a bit
all over the place because as of writing (November 16, 2025), I've only been using NixOS
as one of my daily drivers for a day.

These reflect my habits and quirks as a developer. My `*.nix` files will likely not be
modular until I hit the 1000 line threshold. The neovim configuration is a vestige of a
time before I embraced the long file.

If you want to take a look at my specific configurations and settings, take a look at
[the repo](https://github.com/desertthunder/nixos-conf) that houses these notes. If you
have any requests or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. I haven't decided on a
license but regardless of what I pick, I hope that this ends up being a valuable
resource to anyone that gives it the time. Programming and engineering are fun, and I've
always liked messing with my setup and I hope you have fun too.
